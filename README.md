# Development-of-Interactive-Cyber-Threat-Visualization-Dashboard
This project creates an interactive data-driven dashboard that provides cybersecurity analysts with immediate visual insight into the threat environment. By aggregating and visualizing simulated security incident data (such as CVE feeds and attack logs), it highlights attack patterns, trends, and geographic or system-level hotspots. This allows for proactive risk management, informed resource allocation, and an enhanced security posture.
